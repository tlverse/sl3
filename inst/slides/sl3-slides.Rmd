- This talk will focus on introducing the new `sl3` R package, which provides a
modern implementation of the Super Learner algorithm [@vdl2007super], a method
for performing stacked regressions [@breiman1996stacked], combined with
covariate screening and cross-validation.

# Core `sl3` Design Principles

---

# `sl3` Architecture

All of the classes defined in `sl3` are based on the R6 framework, which brings
a newer object-oriented paradigm to the R language.

## Core classes

- `sl3_Task`: Define ML problem (task). Keep track of data, as well as the variables. Created by `make_sl3_Task()`.

--

- `Lrnr_base`: Base class for defining ML algorithms. Save the
  _fits_ on particular `sl3_Task`s. Different learning
  algorithms are defined in classes that inherit from this class.

--

- `Pipeline`: Define a _sequential_  pipe of learners. The fit of one learner is used by the next one.  
  - Example pipeline: 1) Pre-process covariates (screener / PCA) -> 2) Fit the estimator to pre-processed data.

--

- `Stack`: Stack several ML learners and train them
  _simultaneously_ on the same data. Their predictions can be either combined or
  compared.

???

- Probably good to point out that cross-validating a `Stack` allows for an
  included `Pipeline` to be subjected to CV in the same way as other learners
  (seriously awesome feature).
- Might be worth mentioning the basic differences between core OOP concepts, for
  example classes, objects, methods, fields, inheritance, etc.
- Because all learners inherit from `Lrnr_base`, they have many features in
  common, and can be used interchangeably.
- All learners define three main methods: `train`, `predict`, and `chain`.
- `Pipeline` allows for covariate screening and model fitting to be subjected to
  the same cross-validation process, necessary for Super Learning.

---

# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

- The key concept of OOP is that of an object, a collection of data and
  functions that corresponds to some conceptual unit. Objects have two main
  types of elements: _fields_ and _methods_.
  
--

- _fields_ are information about an object.

--

- _methods_ are actions an object can perform.

--

- Objects are members of _classes_, which define what those specific fields and
  methods are. Classes can inherit elements from other classes.
  
--

- `sl3` is designed using basic OOP principles and the R6 OOP framework, in
  which methods and fields of a class object are accessed using the `$`
  operator.

# The Anatomy of `sl3`

---

# Get the package

- Currently, installation from the `master` branch is the only option:

```{r install_pkg, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jeremyrcoyle/sl3")
```

```{r prelims-pkgs, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(49753)
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library(origami)
library(SuperLearner)
```

--

- Of course, the package will be available on CRAN. An initial release is
  forthcoming.

--

To start using `sl3`, let's load the package:

```{r prelims-pkg, message=FALSE}
library(sl3)
```

---

# A "toy" data set

We use data from the Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP) to illustrate the features of `sl3` as well as its
proper usage. For convenience, the data is included with the `sl3` R package.

```{r prelims-data, message=FALSE}
# load example data set
data(cpp_imputed)

# here are the covariates we are interested in and, of course, the outcome
covars <- c("apgar1", "apgar5", "parity", "gagebrth", "mage", "meducyrs",
            "sexn")
outcome <- "haz"
```

???

- Next, we'll walk through analyzing some data.

---

# Setting up `sl3_Task` I

- `sl3_Task` is the core structure that holds the data set.

- `sl3_Task` specifies the covariates / outcome / outcome_type.

- These spec's must be respected by all learners that work with this task.

```{r sl3-task-setup, message=FALSE}
task <- make_sl3_Task(data = cpp_imputed, covariates = covars,
                      outcome = outcome, outcome_type="continuous")
```

--

- Method `make_sl3_Task()` created a new `sl3_Task`.

- Specified the underlying data (`cpp_imputed`), as well as covariates and outcome.

- Also specified an `outcome_type` ("continuous"). Can be "categorical" / "binomial" / "quasibinomial".

---

# `sl3_Task` Options

- `make_sl3_Task()` has many options providing support for a wide range of ML problems.
  
- For example: 
  - `id` - clustered / repeated-measures data
  - `weights` - survey data
  - `offset` - TMLE

---

# Setting up `sl3_Task` II

Let's take a look at the `task` that we set up:

```{r sl3-task-nodes, message=FALSE}
task
```

---

# Learners I: Introduction

- `Lrnr_base` is the base class for defining ML algorithms.
  - Saves the fits for those algorithms to particular `sl3_Task`s.

--

- Different ML algorithms are defined in classes that inherit from
  `Lrnr_base`.
  
--
  
- For instance, the `Lrnr_glm` class inherits from `Lrnr_base`, and defines a
  learner that fits GLMs.
  
--

- Learner objects can be constructed from their class definitions using the
  `make_learner()` function:

```{r}
# make learner object
lrnr_glm <- make_learner(Lrnr_glm)
```

---

# Learners II: Core Methods

- All learners inherit from `Lrnr_base`, so they have many features in common,
  and can be used interchangeably.

--

- All learners define three main methods: `train`, `predict`, and `chain`.

--

- The first, `train`, takes a `sl3_task` object, and returns a `learner_fit`,
  which has the same class as the learner that was trained:

```{r, message=FALSE}
# fit learner to task data
lrnr_glm_fit <- lrnr_glm$train(task)

# verify that the learner is fit
lrnr_glm_fit$is_trained
```

<!-- - Here, we fit the learner to the CPP task we defined above. Both `lrnr_glm` and
  `lrnr_glm_fit` are objects of class `Lrnr_glm`, although the former defines a
  learner and the latter defines a fit of that learner. -->
<!-- 
- We can distinguish between the learners and learner fits using the `is_trained`
  field, which is true for fits but not for learners. -->

---

# Learners III: Prediction

- Generate default predictions using `predict()` method:

```{r}
preds <- lrnr_glm_fit$predict()
head(preds)
```

--

- Generate predictions for a given new task:

```{r}
preds <- lrnr_glm_fit$predict(task)
head(preds)
```

<!-- - Here, we specified `task` as the task for which we wanted to generate
  predictions. If we had omitted this, we would have gotten the same predictions
  because `predict` defaults to using the task provided to `train` (called the
  training task). Alternatively, we could have provided a different task for
  which we want to generate predictions.

- The final important learner method, `chain`, will be discussed later, when we
  discuss __learner composition__. As with `sl3_Task`, learners have a variety
  of fields and methods we haven't discussed here. -->

---

# Learners IV: Properties

- Learners have _properties_ that indicate what features they support. Use `sl3_list_properties()` to get a list of all properties supported by at least one learner.

```{r}
sl3_list_learners(c("binomial", "offset"))
```
--

- Use `sl3_list_learners()` to find learners supporting any set of properties:

```{r sl3-list-learner}
sl3_list_learners(c("binomial", "offset"))
```

---

# Learners V: Tuning Parameters

- Learners can be instantiated without providing any additional parameters. We tried to provide sensible defaults for each learner.

- YouÂ can modify the learners' behavior by instantiating learners with different parameters.

--

`sl3` Learners support some common parameters (where applicable):

* `covariates`: subsets covariates before fitting. Allows
  learners to be fit to the same task with different covariate subsets.

* `outcome_type`: overrides the task `outcome_type`. Allows
  learners to be fit to the same task with different `outcome_types`.

* `...`: arbitrary parameters can be passed directly to the learner
  method. See documentation for each learner.

---

# Compatibility with `SuperLearner` Package

- Defining a `sl3` learner that uses the `SL.glmnet` wrapper from `SuperLearner`:

```{r SuperLearner Wrapper}
lrnr_sl_glmnet <- make_learner(Lrnr_pkg_SuperLearner, "SL.glmnet")
```

???

- In most cases, using wrappers from `SuperLearner` will not be as efficient as
  their native `sl3` counterparts. If your favorite learner is missing from
  `sl3`, please consider adding it by following the "Defining New Learners"
  vignette.

---


# Dependent Data / Time-series

- `sl3` supports univariate and multivariate time-series. 

- Using "bsds" example dataset, we can make arbitrary size forecasts using one of the "time-series" learners:

```{r sl3-ts, eval=FALSE}
data(bsds)
task <- sl3_Task$new(bsds, covariates = c("cnt"), outcome = "cnt")
#self exciting threshold autoregressive model
tsDyn_learner <- Lrnr_tsDyn$new(learner="setar", m=1, model="TAR", n.ahead=5)
fit_1 <- tsDyn_learner$train(task)
fit_1$predict(task)
```

--

- `sl3` also supports several different options for cross-validation with time-series data, and ensemble forecasting. 

Examples can be found in the "examples" directory on github. 

--

- Currently in works: support for spatial data.

# Composing Learners in `sl3`

---

# Pipelines I

- **A pipeline is a set of learners to be fit _sequentially_, where the fit from
  one learner is used to define the task for the next learner.**

--

- Let's look at one example of chaining via pre-screening of covariates:

  - Below, we generate a screener object based on the `SuperLearner` function
  `screen.corP` and fit it to our task. 

  - Inspecting the fit, we see that it selected a subset of covariates:

```{r sl3-fit-screener, message=FALSE}
screen_cor <- Lrnr_pkg_SuperLearner_screener$new("screen.corP")
screen_fit <- screen_cor$train(task)
print(screen_fit)
```

---

# Pipelines II

- Next, we call `chain()` method to return a new task.
- This will make the pre-screened data available to next learner.

```{r sl3-chain-screener}
screened_task <- screen_fit$chain()
print(screened_task)
```

---

# Pipelines III

<!-- - As with `predict()` method, we can omit a task from the call to `chain()`, in which case
  the call defaults to using the same task that was used for training.
 -->

- We can see that the chained task reduced the covariates to the subset selected
  by the screener. 
- Can fit this new task using previously defined GLM learner `lrnr_glm`:

```{r sl3-glm-on-screened}
screened_glm_fit <- lrnr_glm$train(screened_task)
screened_preds <- screened_glm_fit$predict()
head(screened_preds)
```

---

# Pipelines IV

- The `Pipeline` class automates this process: 
  - Takes an arbitrary number of learners and fits them sequentially, training and chaining each one in turn. 
  - Since `Pipeline` is a learner like any other, it shares the same interface.

--

- Define a pipeline using `make_learner()`, and use `train` and `predict`
  just as we did before:

```{r sl3-define-pipeline}
sg_pipeline <- make_learner(Pipeline, screen_cor, lrnr_glm)
sg_pipeline_fit <- sg_pipeline$train(task)
sg_pipeline_preds <- sg_pipeline_fit$predict()
head(sg_pipeline_preds)
```

--

- We see that the pipeline returns the same predictions as manually training
  `glm` on the chained task from the screening learner.

---

# Pipelines V

```{r sl3-viz-pipeline, echo=FALSE}
dt <- delayed_learner_train(sg_pipeline, task)
plot(dt, color=FALSE, height="300px")
```

- The concept of chaining is much more general.
- There are many ways in which a learner can define the task for the downstream
  learner.
- The `chain()` method of each learner specifies how this works. 
- Any type of pre and post processing of the data fits within the "pipeline" concept.
- Just a few examples of pipelines:
  - PCA (pre-processing) / TMLE / Super-Learner (discussed later)

---

# Stacks I

- **Like `Pipeline`s, `Stack`s combine multiple learners. `Stack`s train
  learners _simultaneously_, so that their predictions can be either combined or
  compared.**

--

- `Stack` is just a special learner and so has the same interface as all
  other learners.
- Here we define and fit a `stack` of two learners: simple `glm` learner and a previous pipeline.
- Both are fit to same data.

```{r sl3-stack}
stack <- make_learner(Stack, lrnr_glm, sg_pipeline)
stack_fit <- stack$train(task)
stack_preds <- stack_fit$predict()
head(stack_preds)
```

???

- We could have included any arbitrary set of learners and pipelines, the latter
  of which are themselves just learners.

- We can see that the `predict` method now returns a matrix, with a column for
  each learner included in the stack.

--- 

---
# Stacks II

```{r sl3-viz-stack, echo=FALSE}
dt <- delayed_learner_train(stack, task)
plot(dt, color=FALSE, height="500px")
```

---

# But What About Cross-validation?

_Almost forgot! CV is necessary in order to honestly evaluate our models and
avoid over-fitting. We provide facilities for easily doing this, based on the
[`origami` package](https://github.com/tlverse/origami)._

--

- The `Lrnr_cv` learner wraps another learner and performs training and
  prediction in a cross-validated fashion, using separate training and
  validation splits as defined by `task$folds`.

--

- Below, we define a new `Lrnr_cv` object based on the previously defined
  `stack` and train it and generate predictions on the validation set:

```{r sl3-cv-stack}
cv_stack <- Lrnr_cv$new(stack)
cv_fit <- cv_stack$train(task)
cv_preds <- cv_fit$predict()
```

---

# Cross-validation (continued...)

- We can also use the special `Lrnr_cv` function `cv_risk` to estimate
  cross-validated risk values:

```{r sl3-cv-risk}
risks <- cv_fit$cv_risk(loss_squared_error)
print(risks)
```

--

- In this example, we don't see much difference between the two learners,
  suggesting the addition of the screening step in the pipeline learner didn't
  improve performance much.

---

# Cross-validation (continued...)

```{r sl3-viz-cv-stack, echo=FALSE}
dt <- delayed_learner_train(cv_stack, task)
plot(dt, color=FALSE, height="500px")
```

# Putting it all together: Super Learning

---

# Super Learner I: Meta-Learners

- _We can combine `Pipeline`s, `Stack`s, and `Lrnr_cv` to easily define a Super
  Learner_.

--

- Using some of the objects we defined in the above examples, this becomes a
  nearly trivial operation:

```{r sl3-metalearner-glm}
metalearner <- make_learner(Lrnr_nnls)
cv_task <- cv_fit$chain()
ml_fit <- metalearner$train(cv_task)
```

--

- Used special learner, `Lrnr_nnls`, for the meta-learning step. Fits a non-negative least squares meta-learner.
- **Any learner can be used as a meta-learner.**

---

# Super Learner II: Pipelines

- The Super Learner is just a pipeline: 
  -  with a _stack_ of  _learners_ trained on full data and the _meta-learner_ trained on the
  validation-set predictions.

--

- Below, we use a special behavior of pipelines: if all objects passed to a
  pipeline are learner fits (i.e., `learner$is_trained` is `TRUE`), the result
  will also be a fit:

```{r sl3-define-SuperLearner}
sl_pipeline <- make_learner(Pipeline, stack_fit, ml_fit)
sl_preds <- sl_pipeline$predict()
head(sl_preds)
```

---

# Super Learner III: `Lrnr_sl`

- **A Super Learner may be fit in a more streamlined manner using the `Lrnr_sl`
  learner.**

--

- For simplicity, we will use the same set of learners and meta-learning
  algorithm as we did before:

```{r sl3-Lrnr_sl}
sl <- Lrnr_sl$new(learners = stack,
                  metalearner = metalearner)
sl_fit <- sl$train(task)
lrnr_sl_preds <- sl_fit$predict()
head(lrnr_sl_preds)
```

--

- We can see that this generates the same predictions as the more hands-on
  definition we encountered previously.

???

- Worth mentioning that the flexibility offered by our design allows us to
  invoke the Super Learner algorithm, but we can also do a lot more...

# Computing with `delayed`

---

# Delayed I

- For large datasets, fitting a Super Learner can be extremely time-consuming.

--

- To alleviate this complication, we've developed a specialized parallelization
  framework `delayed` that parallelizes across these tasks in a way that takes
  into account their inter-dependent nature.

--

- Consider a Super Learner with three learners:

```{r sl3-delayed-sl}
lrnr_rf <- make_learner(Lrnr_randomForest)
lrnr_glmnet <- make_learner(Lrnr_glmnet)
sl <- Lrnr_sl$new(learners = list(lrnr_glm, lrnr_rf, lrnr_glmnet),
                  metalearner = metalearner)
```

--

- We can plot the network of tasks required to train this Super Learner:

```{r sl3-delayed-plot, eval=FALSE}
delayed_sl_fit <- delayed_learner_train(sl, task)
plot(delayed_sl_fit)
```

---

# Delayed II

```{r sl3-delayed-plot-actual, echo=FALSE}
delayed_sl_fit <- delayed_learner_train(sl, task)
plot(delayed_sl_fit, color = TRUE, height="500px")
```


---

# Delayed III

- **shiny demo**
- `delayed` then allows us to parallelize the procedure across these tasks using
  the [`future`](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future) package.

- *n.b.*, This feature is currently experimental and hasn't yet been throughly
  tested on a range of parallel back-ends.

--

- Performance comparisons can be found in the "SuperLearner Benchmarks" vignette
  that accompanies this package.

???

- Fitting a Super Learner is composed of many different training and prediction
  steps, as the procedure requires that the learners in the stack and the
  meta-learner be fit on cross-validation folds and on the full data.

- For more information on specifying `future` `plan`s for parallelization, see
  the documentation of the [`future`](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future)
  package.
