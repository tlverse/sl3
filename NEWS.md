# sl3 1.4.3
* Additional arguments for 'Keras' learners `Lrnr_lstm_keras` and
  `Lrnr_gru_keras` provide support for callback functions list and 2-layer
  networks. Default `callbacks` list provides early stopping criteria with
  respect to 'Keras' defaults and `patience` of 10 epochs. Also, these two 
  'Keras' learners now call `args_to_list` upon initialization, and set 
  verbose argument according to `options("keras.fit_verbose")` or 
  `options("sl3.verbose")`.
* Update `Lrnr_xgboost` to support prediction tasks consisting of one
  observation (e.g., leave-one-out cross-validation).
* Update `Lrnr_sl` by adding a new private slot `.cv_risk` to store the risk
  estimates, using this to avoid unnecessary re-computation in the `print`
  method (the `.cv_risk` slot is populated on the first `print` call, and only
  ever re-printed thereafter).
* Update documentation of `default_metalearner` to use native markdown tables.
* Fix `Lrnr_screener_importance`'s pairing of (a) covariates returned by the 
  importance function with (b) covariates as they are defined in the task. This 
  issue only arose when discrete covariates were automatically one-hot encoded 
  upon task initiation (i.e., when `colnames(task$X) != task$nodes$covariates`).
* Reformat `importance_plot` to plot variables in decreasing order of 
  importance, so most important variables are placed at the top of the dotchart. 
* Enhanced functionality in `sl3` task's `add_interactions` method to support 
  interactions that involve factors. This method is most commonly used by 
  `Lrnr_define_interactions`, which is intended for use with another learner 
  (e.g., `Lrnr_glmnet` or `Lrnr_glm`) in a `Pipeline`.
* Modified `Lrnr_gam` formula (if not specified by user) to not use `mgcv`'s 
  default `k=10` degrees of freedom for each smooth `s` term when there are 
  less than `k=10` degrees of freedom. This bypasses an `mgcv::gam` error, and 
  tends to be relevant only for small n. 
* Added `options(java.parameters = "-Xmx2500m")` and warning message when 
  `Lrnr_bartMachine` is initialized, if this option has not already been set. 
  This option was incorporated since the default RAM of 500MB for a Java 
  virtual machine often errors due to memory issues with `Lrnr_bartMachine`.
* Incorporated `stratify_cv` argument in `Lrnr_glmnet`, which stratifies 
  internal cross-validation folds such that binary outcome prevalence in 
  training and validation folds roughly matches the prevalence in the training 
  task. 
* Incorporated `min_screen` argument `Lrnr_screener_coefs`, which tries to 
  ensure that at least `min_screen` number of covariates are selected. If this 
  argument is specified and the `learner` argument in `Lrnr_screener_coefs` is 
  a `Lrnr_glmnet`, then `lambda` is increased until `min_screen` number of 
  covariates are selected and a warning is produced. If `min_screen` is 
  specified and the `learner` argument in `Lrnr_screener_coefs` is not a 
  `Lrnr_glmnet` then it will error. 
* Updated `Lrnr_hal9001` to work with v0.4.0 of the `hal9001` package.
* Added `formula` parameter and `process_formula` function to the base 
  learner, `Lrnr_base`, whose methods carry over to all other learners. When 
  a `formula` is supplied as a learner parameter, the `process_formula` 
  function constructs a design matrix by supplying the `formula` to 
  `model.matrix`. This implementation allows `formula` to be supplied to all 
  learners, even those without native `formula` support. The `formula` should 
  be an object of class "`formula`", or a character string that can be coerced 
  to that class.

# sl3 1.4.2
* Updates to variable importance functionality, including calculation of risk
  ratio and risk differences under covariate deletion or permutation.
* Addition of a `importance_plot` to summarize variable importance findings.
* Additions of new methods `reparameterize` and `retrain` to `Lrnr_base`, which
  allows modification of the covariate set while training on a conserved task
  and prediction on a new task using previously trained learners, respectively.

# sl3 1.4.1
* [TODO]

# sl3 1.4.0
* [TODO]

# sl3 1.3.9
* [TODO]

# sl3 1.3.8
* Updates to variable importance functionality, including use of risk ratios.
* Change `Lrnr_hal9001` and `Lrnr_glmnet` to respect observation-level IDs.
* Removal of `Remotes` and deprecation of `Lrnr_rfcde` and `Lrnr_condensier`:
  * Both of these learner classes provided support for conditional density
      estimation (CDE) and were useful when support for CDE was more limited.
      Unfortunately, both packages are un-maintained or updated only very
      sporadically, resulting in both frequent bugs and presenting an obstacle
      for an eventual CRAN release (both packages are GitHub-only).
  * `Lrnr_rfcde` wrapped https://github.com/tpospisi/RFCDE, a sporadically
      maintained tool for conditional density estimation (CDE). Support for
      this has been removed in favor of built-in CDE tools, including, among
      others, `Lrnr_density_semiparametric`.
  * `Lrnr_condensier` wrapped https://github.com/osofr/condensier, which
      provided a pooled hazards approach to CDE. This package contained an
      implementation error (https://github.com/osofr/condensier/issues/15) and
      was removed from CRAN. Support for this has been removed in favor of
      `Lrnr_density_semiparametric` and `Lrnr_haldensify`, both of which more
      reliably provide CDE support.
