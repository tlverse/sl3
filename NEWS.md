# sl3 1.4.5
* Changed `CV_lrnr_sl` to `cv_sl`
* Added `Lrnr_glmtree`, which uses the `partykit` R package to fit recursive
  partitioning and regression trees in a generalized linear model.
* Added fold-specific SL coefficients to the output of `cv_sl`, and removed
  the coefficients column from the returned `cv_risk` table.
* Added `get_sl_revere_risk` argument  to `Lrnr_sl`'s `cv_risk` method to 
  provide the option (with default of `FALSE`) to add a super learner's
  revere-based risk (not a true cross-validated risk) to `cv_risk` output.
* Changed default metalearner to `Lrnr_nnls` for binary and continuous outcomes.
* Added `cv_control` argument to `Lrnr_sl`, which allows users to define 
  specific cross-validation structures for fitting the super learner. This is
  intended for use in a nested cross-validation scheme (such as cross-validated 
  super learner, `cv_sl`, or when `Lrnr_sl` is considered in the list of 
  candidate `learners` in another `Lrnr_sl`). In addition to constructing 
  clustered cross-validation with respect to `id`, `cv_control` also 
  can be used to construct stratified cross-validation folds for `Lrnr_sl`.
* `Lrnr_caret` now works for binary and categorical outcomes. Previous versions 
  state that these discrete outcome types are supported by `Lrnr_caret`, but 
  the functionality would brake. 
* Added public function for `sl3_Task`, `get_folds`, which takes in 
  `origami::make_folds` arguments and returns the folds. This function is 
  now called by `task$folds` and it can be called in train as well, to obtain 
  folds from a task that have a non-default fold structure. 
* Learners that use CV internally (i.e., as part of their procedure to select
  tuning parameters), including `Lrnr_caret`, `Lrnr_glmnet`, `Lrnr_hal9001`, 
  and `Lrnr_sl`, use `task$get_folds` to create folds. The learners' folds 
  respect the default CV fold structure in `sl3` tasks (clustered CV when `id` 
  is supplied in the task; and stratified CV when outcomes are categorical or 
  binary, and when `id` are nested in strata if `id` supplied to task). However, 
  `V` can be modified according to the learner-specific parameters. (`Lrnr_sl`
  has a few extra CV tuning arguments, which are thoroughly documented in 
  `cv_control` and modifications are only recommended for advanced use of 
  `Lrnr_sl`.)
* Fixed learner parameter `formula` bug, which was causing formulas with "." to 
  return an empty task, and therefore learners with these formulas to fail. 
* Fixed bug in `Lrnr_cv_selector` metalearner, which was using the wrong folds 
  to calculate the cross-validated risk estimate. This impacted
  `Lrnr_cv_selector` when `eval_function` was not a loss function, e.g. AUC.
  By calling `task$folds` on the metalearner's training task, we were deriving 
  folds from the matrix of cross-validated predictions, and not using the folds 
  for cross-validating the candidates. We now require the folds for cross-
  validating the candidates (i.e., the folds in task for training `Lrnr_sl`) to 
  be supplied when `Lrnr_cv_selector`'s `eval_function` is not a loss function.
* `Lrnr_caret` and `Lrnr_rpart` factor binary outcomes in their `train` methods,
  thereby considering a classification prediction problem. To avoid this 
  behavior and consider a regression prediction problem with a binary outcome 
  (e.g., to minimize the squared error or negative log likelihood loss in a 
  binary outcome prediction problem), users can set 
  `factor_binary_outcome = FALSE` when they instantiate the learner. 
* Tasks can be created without an outcome. This comes in handy when creating 
  a task that is used only for prediction, not for training, and leads 
  to the task's outcome type being set to "none" if it's not supplied. 
* When the variable type of the outcome (i.e., `outcome_type`) is necessary for 
  a learner's `predict` method (e.g., if categorical outcome predictions need to 
  be "packed" together), the outcome type in the **training task** should be 
  used. That is, `private$.training_outcome_type` should be used to obtain
  the outcome type in a learner's `predict` method; the task supplied to 
  `predict` should not be used. The following learners were referring to the
  task supplied to `predict` in order to retain the outcome type, and they were 
  modified to use the training task's outcome type instead: `Lrnr_svm`, 
  `Lrnr_randomForest`, `Lrnr_ranger`, `Lrnr_rpart`, `Lrnr_polspline`. The 
  issue with pulling the outcome type from the task supplied to `predict` is 
  that the outcome type of that task might be "none", if the `outcome` argument 
  is not supplied to it.
* Updated the learner template (inst/templates/Lrnr_template.R) to reflect the 
  new formatting guidelines for learner documentation.
* Updated documentation for `sl3_Task` parameters (man-roxygen/sl3_Task_extra.R). 
  Specifically, `drop_missing_outcome` and `flag` were added; `offset` 
  description was fixed; description of `folds` was added, including how to 
  modify it and the default; and description of how the default cross-validation 
  structure considers `id` and discrete (binary and categorical) outcome types 
  to construct clustered and stratified cross-validation schemes, respectively,
  was added.
* Added documentation for the function `process_data` (R/process_data.R), which
  is called when instantiating a task, to process the covariates and identify 
  missingness in the outcome.
* Added `Lrnr_grfcate`, a prediction function estimator for conditional average 
  treatment effect (CATE), which uses the `causal_forest` function in `grf` 
  package. This learner is intended for use in the `tmle3mopttx` package, where 
  CATE estimation and prediction is required.

# sl3 1.4.4
* Updates to `Lrnr_nnls` to support binary outcomes, including support for
  convexity of the resultant model fit and warnings on prediction quality.
* Refined, clearer documentation for `Lrnr_define_interactions`
* Tweaks to `Lrnr_bound` to better support more flexible bounding for
  continuous outcomes (automatically setting a maximum of infinity).
* Changes to `Lrnr_cv_selector` to support improved computation of the CV-risk,
  averaging the risk strictly across validation/holdout sets.
* Bug fixes for `Lrnr_earth` (improving formals recognition), `Lrnr_glmnet`
  (allowing offsets), and `Lrnr_caret` (reformatting of arguments).

# sl3 1.4.3
* Additional arguments for 'Keras' learners `Lrnr_lstm_keras` and
  `Lrnr_gru_keras` provide support for callback functions list and 2-layer
  networks. Default `callbacks` list provides early stopping criteria with
  respect to 'Keras' defaults and `patience` of 10 epochs. Also, these two
  'Keras' learners now call `args_to_list` upon initialization, and set
  verbose argument according to `options("keras.fit_verbose")` or
  `options("sl3.verbose")`.
* Update `Lrnr_xgboost` to support prediction tasks consisting of one
  observation (e.g., leave-one-out cross-validation).
* Update `Lrnr_sl` by adding a new private slot `.cv_risk` to store the risk
  estimates, using this to avoid unnecessary re-computation in the `print`
  method (the `.cv_risk` slot is populated on the first `print` call, and only
  ever re-printed thereafter).
* Update documentation of `default_metalearner` to use native markdown tables.
* Fix `Lrnr_screener_importance`'s pairing of (a) covariates returned by the
  importance function with (b) covariates as they are defined in the task. This
  issue only arose when discrete covariates were automatically one-hot encoded
  upon task initiation (i.e., when `colnames(task$X) != task$nodes$covariates`).
* Reformat `importance_plot` to plot variables in decreasing order of
  importance, so most important variables are placed at the top of the dotchart.
* Enhanced functionality in `sl3` task's `add_interactions` method to support
  interactions that involve factors. This method is most commonly used by
  `Lrnr_define_interactions`, which is intended for use with another learner
  (e.g., `Lrnr_glmnet` or `Lrnr_glm`) in a `Pipeline`.
* Modified `Lrnr_gam` formula (if not specified by user) to not use `mgcv`'s
  default `k=10` degrees of freedom for each smooth `s` term when there are
  less than `k=10` degrees of freedom. This bypasses an `mgcv::gam` error, and
  tends to be relevant only for small n.
* Added `options(java.parameters = "-Xmx2500m")` and warning message when
  `Lrnr_bartMachine` is initialized, if this option has not already been set.
  This option was incorporated since the default RAM of 500MB for a Java
  virtual machine often errors due to memory issues with `Lrnr_bartMachine`.
* Incorporated `stratify_cv` argument in `Lrnr_glmnet`, which stratifies
  internal cross-validation folds such that binary outcome prevalence in
  training and validation folds roughly matches the prevalence in the training
  task.
* Incorporated `min_screen` argument `Lrnr_screener_coefs`, which tries to
  ensure that at least `min_screen` number of covariates are selected. If this
  argument is specified and the `learner` argument in `Lrnr_screener_coefs` is
  a `Lrnr_glmnet`, then `lambda` is increased until `min_screen` number of
  covariates are selected and a warning is produced. If `min_screen` is
  specified and the `learner` argument in `Lrnr_screener_coefs` is not a
  `Lrnr_glmnet` then it will error.
* Updated `Lrnr_hal9001` to work with v0.4.0 of the `hal9001` package.
* Added `formula` parameter and `process_formula` function to the base
  learner, `Lrnr_base`, whose methods carry over to all other learners. When
  a `formula` is supplied as a learner parameter, the `process_formula
  function constructs a design matrix by supplying the `formula` to
  `model.matrix`. This implementation allows `formula` to be supplied to all
  learners, even those without native `formula` support. The `formula` should
  be an object of class "`formula`", or a character string that can be coerced
  to that class.
* Added factory function for performance-based risks for binary outcomes with
  `ROCR` performance measures `custom_ROCR_risk`. Supports cutoff-dependent and
  scalar `ROCR` performance measures. The risk is defined as 1 - performance,
  and is transformed back to the performance measure in `cv_risk` and
  `importance` functions. This change prompted the revision of argument name
  `loss_fun` and `loss_function` to `eval_fun` and `eval_function`,
  respectively, since the evaluation of predictions relative to the observations
  can be either a risk or a loss function. This argument name change impacted
  the following: `Lrnr_solnp`, `Lrnr_optim`, `Lrnr_cv_selector`, `cv_risk`,
  `importance`, and `CV_Lrnr_sl`.
* Added name attribute to all loss functions, where naming was defined in terms
  of the risk implied by each loss function (i.e., the common name for the
  expected loss). The names in `cv_risk` and `importance` tables now swap "risk"
  with this name attribute.
* Incorporated stratified cross-validation when `folds` are not supplied to the
  `sl3_Task` and the outcome is a discrete (i.e., binary or categorical)
  variable.
* Added to the `importance` method the option to evaluate importance over
  `covariate_groups`, by removing/permuting all covariates in the same group
  together.
* Added `Lrnr_ga` as another metalearner.

# sl3 1.4.2
* Updates to variable importance functionality, including calculation of risk
  ratio and risk differences under covariate deletion or permutation.
* Addition of a `importance_plot` to summarize variable importance findings.
* Additions of new methods `reparameterize` and `retrain` to `Lrnr_base`, which
  allows modification of the covariate set while training on a conserved task
  and prediction on a new task using previously trained learners, respectively.

# sl3 1.4.1
[missing]

# sl3 1.4.0
[missing]

# sl3 1.3.9
[missing]

# sl3 1.3.8
* Updates to variable importance functionality, including use of risk ratios.
* Change `Lrnr_hal9001` and `Lrnr_glmnet` to respect observation-level IDs.
* Removal of `Remotes` and deprecation of `Lrnr_rfcde` and `Lrnr_condensier`:
  * Both of these learner classes provided support for conditional density
      estimation (CDE) and were useful when support for CDE was more limited.
      Unfortunately, both packages are un-maintained or updated only very
      sporadically, resulting in both frequent bugs and presenting an obstacle
      for an eventual CRAN release (both packages are GitHub-only).
  * `Lrnr_rfcde` wrapped https://github.com/tpospisi/RFCDE, a sporadically
      maintained tool for conditional density estimation (CDE). Support for
      this has been removed in favor of built-in CDE tools, including, among
      others, `Lrnr_density_semiparametric`.
  * `Lrnr_condensier` wrapped https://github.com/osofr/condensier, which
      provided a pooled hazards approach to CDE. This package contained an
      implementation error (https://github.com/osofr/condensier/issues/15) and
      was removed from CRAN. Support for this has been removed in favor of
      `Lrnr_density_semiparametric` and `Lrnr_haldensify`, both of which more
      reliably provide CDE support.

# sl3 1.3.7
* Sampling methods for Monte Carlo integration and related procedures.
* A metalearner for the cross-validation selector (discrete super learner).

# sl3 1.3.0
* Fixes incorrect handling of missingness in the automatic imputation procedure.
* Adds new standard learners, including from the `gam` and `caret` packages.
* Adds custom learners for conditional density estimation, including
  semiparametric methods based on conditional mean and conditional mean/variance
  estimation as well as generalized functionality for density estimation via a
  pooled hazards approach.

# sl3 1.2.0
* Default metalearners based on task outcome types.
* Handling of imputation internally in task objects.
* Addition of several new learners, including from the `gbm`, `earth`,
  `polspline` packages.
* Fixing errors in existing learners (e.g., subtle parallelization in `xgboost`
  and `ranger`).
* Support for multivariate outcomes
* Sets default cross-validation to be revere-style.
* Support for cross-validated super learner and variable importance.
