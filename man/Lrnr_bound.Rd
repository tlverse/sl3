\title{Bound Predictions}
\value{
A learner object inheriting from \code{\link{Lrnr_base}} with
methods for training and prediction. For a full list of learner
functionality, see the complete documentation of \code{\link{Lrnr_base}}.
}
\description{
This learner bounds predictions. Intended for use as part of
\code{\link{Pipeline}}.
}
\section{Parameters}{

\itemize{
\item \code{bound}: Either a vector of length two, with lower and upper
bounds, or a vector of length 1 with a lower bound, and the upper will
be set symmetrically as 1 - the lower bound. Both bounds must be
provided when the variable type of the task's outcome is continuous.
